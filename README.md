# TestRepo - adaptable to our needs
our own Zeitgeist communication archive - onboard them into our world

I can't make a forum, but can organize and access files (i.e. entire experiences) the old school HTML // URL way.

That format is what the web is built of, so communication media will remain static for as long as GitHub keeps the lights on.

It's parented by Microsoft, but GitHub does it's own thing and always has.
GH integrates directly into MS Visual Studio Code (we can use as browser). VSCode already has multiple options to integrate GPT-4hatever.5 xTurbo
